###PART 1

software engineering refers to methods , principles and tools to develop and maintain softwares through designing , testing ,deployment and maintainance of the softwares.
software engineering ensuress development of reliable, efficient software systems reducing complexities and making projects cost effective. 


Development of programming languages 
Establishment of software engineering as a discpline in 1960's
Rise of agile methodologies in the 2000's


Requirements - Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design - Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
Implementation - Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications. 
Testing  - Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment - Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Maintainnance - Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.


waterfall uses sequential approach with distinct phases flowing donwards like a waterfall while Agile uses iterative and incremental approachfocused on flexibility ,collaboration and responding to change. 
Agile can be used where user feedback is required whereas Waterfall is used where all features are defined up-front.


Software Developer - Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
Quality Assurance Enginner - Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager -Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.


IDE'S -  provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code (e.g., Visual Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA)
Version Control Systems (VCS) -  tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members (e.g., Git, Subversion).


Communication Gaps - Poor communication within teams can lead to misunderstandings and project delays.
Tight Deadlines - Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
Changing Requirements - requirements can change during the development cycle leading to scope creep. 
STRATEGIES
Communication Gaps - encourage open and effective communication and use of collaboration tools to enhance team interaction. 
Tight Deadlines - effective time management and prioritization along with realistic project planning.
Changing Requirements - Implement Agile Methodologies to accomodate changes to maintain flexibility.


Unit Testing - Testing individual components or modules of software
Intergrtaion Testing - Testing interactions between different components or subsystems
System Testing - Testing the entire software system as a whole.
Acceptance Testing - Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.


###PART 2

Prompt Engineering is the process of creating and refining instructions that guide AI models to generate accurate and useful responses.
It gives developer's more control over the AI's output.
Allows for higher levels os abstraction ,making AI's models more adaptable and scalable.


Vague Prompt - " TELL THE KIDS ABOUT ROBOTS"
Improved Prompt - " EXPLAIN TO THE KIDS THE HISTORY OF ROBOTS TILL DATE IN A SIMPLER LANGUAGE THEY CAN UNDERSTAND AND USING EXAMPLES THEY CAN RELATE TO."
Explanation - the improved prompt is more effecctive because it specifies on what to focus on ( history of robots) and also specify to use a simple language and provide simple examples the kids can easily relate to.
